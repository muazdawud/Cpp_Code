🏦 Designing a Banking System in C++
1. Core Data You Need to Store

At a minimum, a banking system should manage customers and their accounts.

Customer Information

Customer ID (unique identifier)

Full Name

Date of Birth

Address

Phone number / Email

(Optional) Username + Password (for login system)

Account Information

Account Number (unique per account)

Account Type (Savings, Current, Fixed Deposit, etc.)

Balance

Date of creation

Status (active/closed/frozen)

Transaction Records

For history/tracking:

Transaction ID

Account Number (linked to customer)

Date & Time

Type (Deposit, Withdrawal, Transfer)

Amount

Balance after transaction

2. Core Features (Operations)

What should the system do?

Customer Management

Create new customer

Update customer info

View customer details

Account Management

Open account

Close account

View account details (balance, type, etc.)

Banking Operations

Deposit money

Withdraw money

Transfer money (between accounts)

Show transaction history

Authentication (optional, but realistic)

Customer login (username/password)

Admin login (for managing system)

3. How to Store Data

You need persistence (data should not vanish when program ends). Options:

Text Files → Easy, but harder to manage large data

Binary Files → More efficient and secure

Database (like MySQL/SQLite) → More professional, but extra setup

For a beginner → intermediate project, file handling is enough.
